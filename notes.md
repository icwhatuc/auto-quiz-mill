Get syllabus or cirriculum

Sources for key words:
News events
Google Trend: https://www.google.com/trends/
http://techslides.com/hacking-the-google-trends-api
curl --data "ajax=1&pn=p1&htv=m" http://www.google.com/trends/hottrends/hotItems

Scraping something to find syllabi - regents




Things to do:
- Chris should do a 10 min tutorial on markdown - focusing on links, heading, images, and bullet list
- Chris should bring the unused cell phone for a hot spot
- Chris write a script in any language and spit out a bunch of key words - spit out key word + new line - python - web user agent
- Mihir will do something similar with news feed and another tool that extracts key words - probably perl
